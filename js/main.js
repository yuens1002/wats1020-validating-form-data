/* Custom JS goes here. */

// For this assignment you'll need to do a few things:
// 1. Create a document ready handler.
// 2. Define a validation object for use on your page.
// 3. Connect the validation object to an event handler tied to the submit button.

// Refer to the `index.html` file for the validation rules that must be enforced.
